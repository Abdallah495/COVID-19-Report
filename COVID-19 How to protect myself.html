   <li><b><font size="4"> Maintain at least a 1-metre distance between yourself and others</b> to reduce your risk of infection when they cough, sneeze or speak. Maintain an even greater distance between yourself and others when indoors. The further away, the better.</li><br>

    <li><b>Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people. The appropriate use, storage and cleaning or disposal are essential to make masks as effective as possible.</b></li><br>


<li><b>Here are the basics of how to wear a mask:</b><br>
<br>

   <li> Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time.</li><br>

   <li> Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin.</li><br>

    <li>When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a fabric mask, or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin.
    Don’t use masks with valves.</li><br>



    <li>For specifics on what type of mask to wear and when, read our Q&A and watch our  videos. There is also a Q&A focused on masks and children.</li><br>

    <li>Find out more about the science of how COVID-19 infects people and our bodies react by watching or reading this interview.
    For specific advice for decision makers, see WHO’s technical guidance.</li><br>
