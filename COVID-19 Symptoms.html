What happens to people who get COVID-19?

  <p>
Among those who develop symptoms, most (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. About 15% become seriously ill and require oxygen and 5% become critically ill and need intensive care.<br/>

Complications leading to death may include respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, thromboembolism, and/or multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys.<br/>

In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection.<br/>
